Elements: elements are nothimg but complete tag with its content i,e., tag+content+close tag
for eg:
<h1>
    hello
</h1>
note: all elements needs not to closed. some elements dont have any closing tag. they are called void elements or empty elements or self cloaing elements
eg: <img scr="" alt="" />,<br />,<hr />\

we can group the elements and make the groups as block or inline for styling
