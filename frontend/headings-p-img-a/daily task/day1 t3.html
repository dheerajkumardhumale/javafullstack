    <h1>Using Quotation and Citation Tags in HTML</h1>

<p>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>

<blockquote>"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving." <strong>//this is a blockquoted text</strong></blockquote>

<p>In the context of this discussion, one might say: <strong>//this is paragraph</strong></p>

<p><q> To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</q> <strong>//this is quoted text</strong></p>

<p>This quote is widely attributed to <cite> Albert Einstein.</cite> <strong> //this is a citation tag.</strong></p>

<p>In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example, if you're referencing a famous work like <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>// <strong> is a citation tag. </strong><br> by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.</p>

<p>Another classic example can be seen in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite><strong>//this is a citation tag.</strong> <br>by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy intertwine to create a timeless story.</p>
